# FastTrack Keyboard Shortcuts

This document lists all available keyboard shortcuts in the FastTrack Issue Manager application.

## Main Window Shortcuts

| Shortcut | Action | Description |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| **Ctrl+N** | New Issue | Clear all form fields to create a new issue. If the form has content, you'll be asked to confirm. |
| **Ctrl+S** | Submit Issue | Submit the current issue. Same as clicking the "Submit Issue" button. |
| **Ctrl+L** | Load Issue | Open the "Load Issue" dialog to search and load an existing issue. |
| **Ctrl+V** | View Issues | Open the "View Issues" dialog with the full issue table and filtering options. |
| **Ctrl+R** | Refresh Summary | Refresh the issue summary table in the left pane to show updated counts. |
| **Ctrl+O** | View Open Issues | Open a dialog showing detailed information about all open issues. |
| **Ctrl+T** | Toggle Theme | Switch between light and dark theme modes. |

## Dialog Shortcuts

| Shortcut | Action | Description |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| **Escape** | Close Dialog | Close most dialogs without saving changes (except NoEscapeDialog). |
| **Enter** | Confirm | In most dialogs, pressing Enter will confirm/accept the action. |

## Tips

- All shortcuts are case-insensitive (Ctrl+N is the same as Ctrl+n)
- Shortcuts work when the main window or its child widgets have focus
- Tooltips on buttons show their associated keyboard shortcuts
- Use **Ctrl+N** frequently to quickly start fresh issue creation
- Use **Ctrl+L** and **Ctrl+V** to quickly navigate between issues

## Future Shortcuts (Planned)

The following shortcuts may be added in future versions:
- **Ctrl+F**: Focus search field in dialogs
- **Ctrl+D**: Delete selected issue
- **Ctrl+E**: Export to HTML
- **Ctrl+A**: Add attachments
- **F5**: Refresh current view
