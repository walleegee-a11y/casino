```

**Date Filters** (Coming Soon):

### 7. Analytics Dashboard 📈

**Coming Soon in UI** - Currently available via code:

```python
from ftrack_analytics import IssueDashboard

dashboard = IssueDashboard(database)

# Get metrics
status_summary = dashboard.get_status_summary()
print(f"Open: {status_summary['Open']}")

# Resolution times
metrics = dashboard.get_resolution_metrics()
print(f"Average resolution: {metrics['overall']['avg_days']} days")

# Trends
trends = dashboard.get_status_trend(days=30)
```

---

### 8. Activity Tracking 💬

**Coming Soon in UI** - Currently available via code:

Track all changes and add comments:

```python
from ftrack_activity import ActivityTracker

tracker = ActivityTracker(database)

# Add comment
tracker.add_comment("0001_20250127_120000", "john",
    "Fixed the memory leak. @sarah please review")

# Track changes automatically
tracker.track_field_change("0001_20250127_120000", "john",
    "status", "Open", "Resolved")

# Get timeline
events = tracker.get_activity_timeline("0001_20250127_120000")
for event in events:
    print(tracker.format_activity_for_display(event))
```

---

### 9. Smart Attachments 🗂️

Automatic deduplication saves disk space:

**How it works**:
- Files are hashed (SHA256)
- Identical files stored only once
- Reference counting tracks usage
- Orphaned files automatically cleaned up

**Storage Savings**: Typically 20-40% reduction

**Coming Soon in UI** - Currently available via code:

```python
from ftrack_attachments import AttachmentManager

manager = AttachmentManager(database, "/path/to/attachments")

# Cleanup orphaned files
deleted, space_freed = manager.cleanup_orphaned_files()
print(f"Freed {space_freed / 1024 / 1024:.1f} MB")

# Get stats
stats = manager.get_storage_stats()
print(f"Deduplication ratio: {stats['deduplication_ratio']:.1f}%")
```

---

### 10. Database Performance 🚀

**10-100x faster** than YAML-only approach!

**First-time setup** (run once):

```python
from ftrack_database import IssueDatabase

# Create database
db = IssueDatabase("/path/to/FastTrack/issues.db")

# Import existing YAML files
db.sync_from_yaml("/path/to/FastTrack")
```

**Usage**:

```python
# Fast search
results = db.search_issues("memory leak")

# Fast filtering
critical = db.filter_issues(severity="Critical", status="Open")

# Quick summary
summary = db.get_status_summary()
```

---

## Pro Tips 💡

### 1. Efficient Issue Management

- Use **Ctrl+N** frequently to clear the form
- Use **Ctrl+L** to quickly load and modify issues
- Save filter presets for common views
- Use drag & drop for multiple attachments

### 2. Better Organization

- Create filter presets for each project phase:
  - "Design Issues"
  - "DFT Blockers"
  - "Sign-off Items"
- Use consistent naming in titles for better searching
- Tag critical modules in "Affected Blocks"

### 3. Team Collaboration

- Use @mentions in comments (coming soon in UI)
- Export HTML reports for status meetings
- Check "View Open Issues" daily
- Update status promptly

### 4. Customization

- Toggle dark mode for long sessions (less eye strain)
- Create personal filter presets:
  - "My Open Tasks"
  - "Issues I Assigned"
  - "This Week's Resolves"

---

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Can't find old issues

**Solution**: Make sure database is synced:
```python
from ftrack_database import IssueDatabase
db = IssueDatabase("/path/to/issues.db")
db.sync_from_yaml("/path/to/FastTrack")
```

### Issue: Drag & drop not working

**Check**:
1. Files exist on disk (not network shortcuts)
2. Total size under 100MB
3. Project directory is set correctly

### Issue: Dark mode doesn't apply to dialogs

**Solution**: This is expected. Close and reopen the dialog to see theme changes.

### Issue: Filter presets not saving

**Check**:
1. You have write permissions to FastTrack directory
2. You clicked "Save Current Filters" button
3. You entered a preset name

---

## Migration from FastTrack 1.0

FastTrack 2.0 is **fully backward compatible**!

### Your existing data is safe:

- ✅ All YAML files work as before
- ✅ All attachments remain in place
- ✅ All issue IDs unchanged
- ✅ No data loss

### Optional: Enable new features

To use database-powered features:

```python
from ftrack_database import IssueDatabase

# One-time setup
db = IssueDatabase("FastTrack/issues.db")
db.sync_from_yaml("FastTrack")

# Database is now ready!
# YAML files still work normally
```
