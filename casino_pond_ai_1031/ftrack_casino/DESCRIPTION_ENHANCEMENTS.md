# FastTrack Description & History Enhancements

## Overview

The FastTrack issue tracking system has been enhanced with modern UI/UX improvements for description editing and history viewing, bringing it in line with contemporary tools like GitHub, Linear, and Jira.

    print("Hello, World!")
```

| Feature | Status |
|---------|--------|
| Editor  | âœ… Done |

```

### 2. Enhanced History Dialog with Visual Diff ðŸ“Š

### 3. Improved Integration

**Changes to existing code:**

- Replaced simple text dump history with visual timeline (gui.py:2195-2219)
- Added automatic data reload after history dialog closes
- Updated tooltips and descriptions array after modifications

## Installation

### Required Dependencies

**Mandatory:**
- PyQt5 (already required)
- difflib (Python standard library)
- yaml (already required)

**Optional (for markdown preview):**
```bash
pip install markdown
```

If markdown is not installed, the editor works in plain text mode with a helpful message.

## Technical Architecture

### Class Structure

```
MarkdownDescriptionEditor (QDialog)
â”œâ”€â”€ QTabWidget
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Edit Tab (QTextEdit)
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Preview Tab (QTextBrowser)
â”œâ”€â”€ Formatting Toolbar (HBoxLayout)
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Bold, Italic, Code, Heading, List buttons
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Statistics Label
â””â”€â”€ Action Buttons (Save/Cancel)

DescriptionHistoryDialog (QDialog)
â”œâ”€â”€ Header (Search box + version count)
â”œâ”€â”€ Timeline (QScrollArea)
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Current Version Card (QFrame - green)
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ History Cards (QFrame - white)
â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ Version metadata header
â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ Expandable diff widget (QTextBrowser)
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ Action buttons (Show Diff, Restore)
â””â”€â”€ Bottom Buttons (Export, Close)
```

### Data Flow

```
1. User clicks "Modify"
   â†“
2. MarkdownDescriptionEditor opens with current description
   â†“
3. User edits and saves
   â†“
4. Create history entry with:
   - timestamp
   - user
   - old_description
   â†“
5. Update YAML file
   â†“
6. Refresh GUI (tooltips, table, description display)
```

### History Entry Schema

```yaml
description_history:
  - timestamp: "2025-11-01 14:30:22"
    user: "username"
    old_description: "Previous version of description..."
    restored_from: null  # or "Version #3 (2025-11-01 12:00:00)"
```

## Compatibility

**Backward Compatible:** âœ…
- Works with existing YAML files (no migration needed)
- Gracefully handles issues without history
- Falls back to plain text if markdown not installed
- Preserves existing history format

**Forward Compatible:** âœ…
- New history entries include all necessary metadata
- Restoration tracking is optional (backward compatible)
- Export feature doesn't modify source data

## Performance

**Optimizations:**
- Lazy diff generation (only when expanded)
- Efficient timeline rendering with QVBoxLayout
- Minimal memory footprint (history loaded on demand)
- Fast search with Python string operations

## Future Enhancements (Not Implemented)

These are potential future improvements based on the initial research:

1. **Side-by-side diff view:** Split screen comparison
2. **Version tagging:** Add custom labels to important versions
3. **Comments on versions:** Add notes explaining changes
4. **Auto-save drafts:** Save work-in-progress every 30 seconds
5. **Syntax highlighting:** In markdown code blocks
6. **Diff word-level:** Highlight specific words that changed
7. **Collaborative editing:** Real-time multi-user editing

## Testing

### Manual Testing Checklist

- [ ] Open FastTrack GUI: `python ftrack_casino.py`
- [ ] Click on issue title to open description
- [ ] Click "Modify" â†’ Verify markdown editor opens
- [ ] Test formatting buttons (bold, italic, code, etc.)
- [ ] Switch to Preview tab â†’ Verify markdown renders correctly
- [ ] Edit description and save â†’ Verify success message
- [ ] Click "History" â†’ Verify timeline appears
- [ ] Click "Show Diff" on a version â†’ Verify color-coded diff appears
- [ ] Test search box â†’ Verify filtering works
- [ ] Click "Restore" on old version â†’ Verify confirmation and restoration
- [ ] Click "Export History" â†’ Verify HTML file is created and valid
- [ ] Open exported HTML in browser â†’ Verify all data is present

### Known Limitations

1. **Markdown library optional:** Preview requires `pip install markdown`
2. **Large histories:** Very long histories (100+ versions) may scroll slowly
3. **Diff performance:** Very large descriptions (10,000+ lines) may render slowly
4. **Unicode support:** Some emoji might not render on all systems

## Troubleshooting

### Markdown preview shows warning
**Solution:** Install markdown library: `pip install markdown`

### History dialog is empty
**Possible causes:**
- No modifications made yet (expected behavior)
- History data corrupted in YAML (check file manually)

### Diff colors not showing
**Possible causes:**
- QTextBrowser CSS issue (check Qt version)
- Try clicking "Show Diff" again

### Export fails
**Possible causes:**
- Insufficient permissions for target directory
- Invalid characters in filename (choose different location)

## Summary

âœ… **Timeline view** for better history browsing
âœ… **Version restoration** with one click
âœ… **Search & filter** for quick navigation
